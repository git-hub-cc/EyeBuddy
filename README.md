## üåü Features

EyeBuddy integrates four core training modes to comprehensively cover different eye care needs:

1.  **E-Chart & Lens Accommodation Training**
   *   **Dynamic E-Chart**: Simulates a standard LogMAR chart with adjustable "E" sizes.
   *   **Blur Cycle**: Automatically cycles through increasing and decreasing blur levels to effectively train the eye's lens to focus and relax.
   *   **Manual Control**: Allows manual adjustment of the blur level for personalized training.

2.  **Smooth Pursuits Training**
   *   **Multiple Paths**: Offers various movement paths, including horizontal, circular, and infinity symbol (‚àû).
   *   **Adjustable Speed**: Freely control the object's speed, from a slow, relaxing pace to a fast-paced challenge.
   *   **Flicker Mode**: Set an object flicker frequency to increase training difficulty and improve tracking stability.

3.  **Saccades Training**
   *   **Rapid Eye Jumps**: Train your eyes to jump quickly and accurately between multiple random targets.
   *   **Custom Difficulty**: Set the number of targets and the jump speed to progressively improve the eye's positioning ability and reaction speed.

4.  **Chinese Eye Exercises**
   *   **Dual Versions**: Includes both the "new" and "classic" versions of the exercises with audio and diagrams.
   *   **Audio Guidance**: Follow the familiar commands and music to close your eyes, relax, and massage acupressure points around the eyes. A perfect break during work or study.
